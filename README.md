*Secure User Authentication using Spring Security 6

This project implements robust user authentication using Spring Boot's security framework, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of user data.

*Key Features:*

- *User Authentication:* Users can log in with their credentials, which are verified against a database or other authentication mechanisms.
- *Authorization:* Access control is enforced, restricting unauthorized users from accessing sensitive resources.
- *Password Encryption:* Passwords are securely stored using bcrypt or other password encoders, protecting them from unauthorized access.
- *Session Management:* User sessions are managed, tracking login/logout status and enforcing session expiration.
- *CSRF Protection:* Protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks is enabled, ensuring only legitimate requests are processed.

*Technologies Used:*

- Spring Boot
- Spring Security
- Database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)
- Password Encoder (e.g., bcrypt)

*Security Best Practices:*

- Secure password storage
- Regular security updates and patches
- Validations and sanitization of user input
- Protection against common web attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS)

*Getting Started:*

1. Clone the repository
2. Configure the database and authentication mechanisms
3. Run the application
4. Test user authentication and authorization
